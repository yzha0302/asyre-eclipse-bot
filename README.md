**Your AI agent gave you a perfect answer on message 1. What about message 50?**

**You started a new chat to fix it. Now where did that design discussion go?**

**Your team uses 5 different AI tools. None of them talk to each other.**

<br>

### Config-driven Discord AI workspace.<br>Isolated threads. Injected skill context. Human-controlled lifecycle.

## Why This Exists

If you have used AI agents for any meaningful period of time, you have experienced the degradation problem. You start a conversation, the AI is sharp, follows instructions perfectly, produces exactly what you want. Then you ask it to do something else in the same chat. Then something else. By message 30, it is confused. By message 50, it is hallucinating — referencing things you never said, mixing up tasks, forgetting constraints you set 20 messages ago.

This is not a bug. This is how large language models work. They have a context window — a fixed amount of text they can "see" at any given time. Every message you send pushes older messages further away. The AI does not truly "remember" — it re-reads the visible conversation each time. When the conversation gets long enough, critical instructions fall out of view, and the AI starts filling gaps with plausible-sounding fabrications.

Most teams deal with this by starting new chats manually. But that creates a different problem: scattered context. Your design discussion is in one chat, the follow-up is in another, the final version is in a third, and nobody can find anything. There is no structure, no lifecycle, no way to say "this task started here and ended here."

Eclipse Bot exists to solve both problems at once.

### The Core Insight: Context Isolation + Skill Injection

The fundamental idea is simple but powerful:

**Every AI task gets its own isolated thread, and every thread starts with the right skill context injected automatically.**

When a user clicks "Open" on a writing panel, Eclipse Bot does not just create an empty thread. It creates a thread and immediately posts a structured context message that tells the AI:

- What skill this is (e.g., "deep content writing")
- What type of task the user selected (e.g., "opinion piece")
- What the AI should do (the full skill definition — process, quality criteria, output format)
- What constraints apply

The AI enters the conversation with clear, fresh instructions. It does not need to guess what it should be doing. It does not carry baggage from previous conversations. It reads the injected context, waits for the user's input, and executes the skill.

When the task is done, the user clicks "Archive." The AI processes the output (summarizes, saves files, publishes — whatever the skill defines), and the thread is closed. Clean start, clean end.

This is not a theoretical improvement. We have run this system in production across 4 Discord communities with 80+ active skill panels. The difference in AI output quality between a scoped thread with injected context versus an unstructured chat conversation is dramatic.

### Why Discord?

**1. Teams already live there.** For communities, creative teams, small companies, and especially teams working with AI agents — Discord is already the daily workspace. Zero adoption friction.

**2. Threads are the perfect AI task container.** Naturally isolated, auto-archivable, searchable, nested under parent channels. Rich media support. Built-in member management. Exactly what an AI task needs.

**3. The bot ecosystem is mature.** Discord.js is battle-tested. Bots can manage channels, permissions, threads, and messages programmatically. An entire AI workspace deployed with one command.

## How It Actually Works

### The Skill Panel System

A Skill Panel is a permanent message (embed + buttons) in a Discord channel. Each channel is dedicated to one type of work.



```
Channel: #deep-writing
+------------------------------------------+
|  ✍️ Deep Writing System                  |
|                                          |
|  Select a content type to start a new    |
|  writing task. AI joins with full skill  |
|  context injected.                       |
|                                          |
|  [✍️ Open] [📦 Archive] [📜 History] [🗑️ Clean] |
+------------------------------------------+
```

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/panel-skill-forge.png" width="450" alt="Skill Forge Panel">
<br><em>Skill Forge panel. Title: "Skill Workshop — Create, improve, and audit Agent skills." Three workflows: create new skill, view skill list, view history. Buttons: Start, Archive, History, Clean.</em>
</div>

**Open** — User clicks, selects task type. Eclipse Bot:
1. Creates a thread with unique ID (e.g., `ASYR-042`)
2. Adds AI bot + team members
3. Posts skill context (what the AI should do, quality criteria, output format)
4. AI receives a message like:

```
Task context:
- Skill: content-writing
- Type: Opinion Piece
- Description: Express a strong viewpoint — persuasion + value guidance

Read the skill docs and prepare for Opinion Piece work.
```

The AI knows exactly what to do before the user even speaks. No guessing. No hallucinations from mixed context.



**Archive** — AI processes the thread output (summarizes, saves files, publishes). Thread marked complete.

**History** — Query past completed tasks.

**Clean** — Remove non-panel messages from channel.

### Why One Channel = One Skill

When each channel serves one skill, the workspace becomes self-documenting:

```
Instead of:
  #general-ai-chat (500 messages, AI confused, nobody knows what's done)

You get:
  #deep-writing     -> ASYR-001 Article about AI agents (archived, done)
                    -> ASYR-002 Weekly newsletter (in progress)
  #design-studio    -> DSGN-001 Landing page mockup (archived, done)
  #client-quotes    -> QUOT-001 Manufacturing client (in progress)
```

Every task traceable. Every AI interaction scoped. Archive ensures nothing lost.

</div>


### The Lifecycle Model

```
[Idle] --> User clicks Open --> [Active Thread]
                                     |
                              User works with AI
                                     |
                              User clicks Archive --> [Processed & Closed]
                                                           |
                                                    AI saves output
                                                    Thread archived
                                                           |
                                                      [Done] --> searchable, traceable
```

Without this: threads pile up, no clear status, stale AI context, cluttered workspace.

With this: clear beginning and end, forced final deliverable, clean workspace, full auditability.

## How Eclipse Bot Connects to Your AI

Eclipse Bot is the **UI layer**. It does not contain AI logic. It:

1. Creates structured threads with skill context
2. @mentions your AI bot in the thread
3. Your AI bot reads the context and executes

```
Eclipse Bot (this project)     Your AI Bot (separate project)
         |                              |
   Manages panels               Reads skill context
   Creates threads               Executes tasks
   Handles buttons               Responds in threads
   Injects context               Processes archives
         |                              |
         +--------- Discord -----------+
```

Your AI bot can be anything: OpenAI assistant, Claude agent, LangChain bot, custom framework. Eclipse Bot does not care. It just needs something that reads Discord messages and responds.

This separation means:
- **AI-agnostic** — swap AI backends without touching Eclipse Bot
- **Independent scaling** — upgrade AI without redeploying the panel system
- **Multiple AI bots** — different AI for different channels (writing AI, data AI, creative AI)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) -> New Application -> Bot
2. Copy token. Enable intents: **Message Content**, **Server Members**, **Presence**
3. Invite with `bot` + `applications.commands` scopes + `Administrator` permission

### 2. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yzha0302/asyre-asyre-eclipse-bot.git
cd asyre-eclipse-bot
npm install
```

### 3. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp src/bot-config.example.json src/bot-config.json
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
CLIENT_TOKEN="your-bot-token"
CLIENT_ID="your-bot-client-id"
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

Edit `src/bot-config.json`:
```json
{
  "bot": {
    "id": "your-bot-client-id",
    "ownerId": "your-discord-user-id",
    "developers": ["your-discord-user-id"]
  },
  "defaults": { "brand": "My Bot", "color": 15105570 },
  "guilds": {
    "your-guild-id": {
      "brand": "My Community",
      "welcome": { "enabled": true, "channelId": "welcome-channel-id" },
      "team": { "mention": ["your-user-id"] }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Finding Discord IDs**: Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode -> right-click anything -> Copy ID

### 4. Build & Run

```bash
npm run setup    # Initialize database
npm run build    # Compile TypeScript
npm start        # Start the bot
```

Production (PM2):
```bash
pm2 start dist/index.js --name eclipse-bot
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

### 5. Deploy Panels

```bash
# Preview
node templates/deploy-template.cjs templates/content-creator.json \
  --guild YOUR_GUILD_ID --bot YOUR_BOT_ID --brand "My Studio" --dry-run

# Deploy
node templates/deploy-template.cjs templates/content-creator.json \
  --guild YOUR_GUILD_ID --bot YOUR_BOT_ID --brand "My Studio"
```

## Origin

Eclipse Bot is extracted from a production system running daily across 4 Discord communities with 80+ active skill panels. The 6 templates contain real production configurations refined through thousands of AI task executions. The open/archive workflow has been the primary AI interaction model for these communities for months.

The decision to open-source came from seeing how many teams struggle with AI context management. The solution is not more powerful AI — it is better structure around how humans interact with AI.
